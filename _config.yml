# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  matador is an object relational mapping framework written in C++.
  It aims to encapsulate all database backend communication. You don't
  have to deal with database backends or sql statements neither with
  mapping of data types or serialization of objects. It comes with
  relation handling out of the box, brings a unique container for all
  kind of objects, a fluent sql query interface. On top all features
  are combined into a ORM layer.
