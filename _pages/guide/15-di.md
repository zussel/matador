## Dependency Injection

This part of matatdor provide a simple C++ dependency injection or service locator mechanism.

The mechanism is as simple as possible. Every service can be injected with the ```inject<T>``` class.
Once the dependencies are set up each dependency can be injected like this:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
di::inject<igreeter> greeter;
greeter->greet()
{% endhighlight %}
