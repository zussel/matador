## Networking

Matador comes with a simple network stack realized through the reactor pattern. The groundwork is realized through the ```address```, ```peer``` and ```socket``` classes. Based on these classes the reactor consists of the ```reactor```, ```Ã cceptor```, ```connector``` and the an implementation of a ```handler``` handling an open network connection.

### Protocol

The reactor supports the __TCP__ and the __UDP__ protocoll. Based on these to protocolls there are two classes ```tcp``` and ```udp```. These classes provides shortcuts to the socket and peer types.

Therefor two classes ```tcp``` and ```udp``` with type definitions for ```peer```, ```socket```, ```acceptor``` and (address) ```resolver``` exists in header ```ip.hpp```.

### Network Address

The ```address``` class represents either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address. An IpV4 or IPv6 address can easily created with the following lines:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
auto google_v4 = address::v4::from_hostname("www.google.org");
auto google_v6 = address::v6::from_hostname("www.google.org");
{% endhighlight %}

In the same way an address can be created from an IP address:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
auto localhost_v4 = address::v4::from_ip("127.0.0.1");
auto localhost_v6 = address::v6::from_ip("::1");
{% endhighlight %}

There are also shortcuts for __broadcast__, __loopback__ and __any__ addresses:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
address broadcast_v4 = address::v4::broadcast();
address broadcast_v6 = address::v6::broadcast();

address localhost_v4 = address::v4::loopback();
address localhost_v6 = address::v6::loopback();

address any_v4 = address::v4::any();
address any_v6 = address::v6::any();
{% endhighlight %}

### Peer

A peer constists of an address and a port. It represents a network connection endpoint of either the local or the remote side.

Below see an example to create a peer for localhost at port 8080:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
address localhost = address::v4::loopback();
tcp::peer localhost8080(localhost, 8080);
{% endhighlight %}

### Socket

A socket represents a network connection between two network endpoints (peers). The connection can either be connected or closed.

### Reactor

The ```reactor``` class implements a __single threaded__ ```select()``` based reactor pattern.

**Note:** In a future release the reactor will be multi threaded to increase performance.

### Acceptor

The ```acceptor``` class accepts a connection within the running reactor. It needs an endpoint to listen on and an accept handler which is called once a connection was established. It returns an implementation of
the ```handler``` class which is then registered within the reactor.

### Connector

The ```connector``` class connects to a given connection endpoint and once the connection is established by the remote side a

### Handler

The ```handler`` class provides an interface for an established connection which must be overwritten by the concrete implementation.

The following interfaces might be implemented depending on the purpose of the concrete handler implementation:

* ```on_input()```: Called every time the connection has data to read
* ```on_output()```: Called every time the connection has data to write
* ```on_except()```: Called every time the connection has exceptionell data available
* ```on_timeout()```: Called every time a scheduled timeout for this handlers occurred
* ```on_close()```: Called when the connection is about to close
* ```open()```: Called when an handler is opened
* ```close()```: Called when an handler is closed
* ```is_ready_write()```: Called by the reactor to check if there is data ready to write
* ```is_ready_read()```: Called by the reactor to check if there is data ready to read
* ```name()```: Returns a name for this handler

### IO Service

The ```io_service``` encapsulates 
### IO Stream

### Stream Handler

Finally the ```stream_handler``` class implements the ```handler``` and 
the ```io_stream``` interface.

More coming soon with the next release (0.8.0)
